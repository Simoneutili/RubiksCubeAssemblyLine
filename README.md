# Automatic Assembly Line for Rubik's Cube Core Assembly

**A Simulated Control System for Automated Rubik's Cube Assembly**

---

## Overview

This project represents a comprehensive automation solution designed for the assembly of the core structure of a Rubik's Cube (Speedcube). The system integrates pneumatic actuation, mechanical handling, and electrical control to achieve a continuous production cycle. Developed as part of an engineering project, the design is fully simulated using advanced CAD and pneumatic simulation tools.

## Project Description

The assembly line is responsible for:
- **Processing and Assembly:** Handling and positioning the central core and center pieces to form the Rubik's Cube.
- **Pneumatic Actuation:** Utilizing 11 pneumatic actuators (7 double-acting cylinders, 2 rotary actuators, and 2 pneumatic grippers) that operate in a precise sequence.
- **Sequenced Operation:** Coordinating two intermittent conveyors for the delivery of cube cores and center pieces, triggered by a start button and managed via sensor signals.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring each assembly phase is verified by proximity and limit sensors, guaranteeing proper sequencing and safe operation.

## System Architecture

- **Pneumatic Circuit & Control:**  
  The circuit is engineered for sequential actuation of multiple pneumatic components. Detailed diagrams (Grafcet and phase movement) illustrate the control logic, fault detection, and safety mechanisms.

- **CAD Modeling:**  
  The design was developed using Creo, resulting in a detailed CAD model of the assembly line. This model provides a visual representation of the machine’s layout and components.

- **Simulation:**  
  The pneumatic circuit and operational phases were simulated using Fluidsim to validate the system's performance and reliability before physical implementation.
